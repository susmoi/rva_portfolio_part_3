  <p>Richmond is the capital of the great state of Virginia, one of the original 13 states. As such there are a number of things one must do, when visiting the city.

  <br><br>I suggest starting with the James river, a staple of Richmond summers and how the city got it's name. Richmond's founder came up with the name as an homage to a similar city in London, which also sat next to a winding river.

  <br><br>Next I suggest stopping by The Diamond, to catch a Flying Squrriels game. During the holidays, the Diamond hosts various events for the community.

  <br><br>No trip to Richmond is complete without visiting one of our historic neighborhoods. One of my favorites is Church Hill. Home to a great BBQ restaurant, and where Patrick Henry gave his famous speech, Give me Liberty or Give me Death!"

  <br><br>When you are in Richmond all roads lead to Broad Street. It is the unoffical main street of Richmond also know as the street which never sleeps.
  <br><br>Another famous, or infamous depending on who you ask, street in Richmond is Monument Avenue. Monument avenue is widely known for the statues of Confederate soliders, but I am here to highlight the statue of Arther Ashe. The African American tennis phenome who went from practicing his serve in Battery Park to winning three grand slam titles.

  <br><br>There is no way to cover all of what Richmond has to offer, you just have to come and visit for yourself.</p>
